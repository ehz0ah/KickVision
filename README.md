# KickVision
- This repository will feature a comprehensive computer vision and machine learning project dedicated to football analysis. 
- It employs YOLO for object detection, K-means clustering for pixel segmentation, optical flow for motion tracking, and perspective transformation to analyze player movements in football videos.

## Datasets
- 30s football clips: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dfl-bundesliga-data-shootout/data?select=clips
- Fine tuning and training of YOLO: https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-jvuqo/football-players-detection-3zvbc/dataset/1
